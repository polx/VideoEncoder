Usage:  java -jar videoEncdoder.jar <pathToVideo> <output-directory?> <path-prefix?>

  Option: add "-Dencoder.tmpdir=<tmpDir>" before -jar to choose the place
             where the encoder will run (and produce temporary files). Otherwise
             the current directory is used (it should not be the output-directory)
          add "-Dffmpeg.path=<pathToFFmpeg>" to specify the place where
             ffmpeg should be called (e.g. important if containing particular codecs)

  This encoder calls ffmpeg to analyze sizes of the video and request re-encoding
  to a Low-Quality and an High-Quality web-based variants in MP4 and WEBM codecs.
  (low-quality: fits in 640 x 360; high-quality: fits in 1280 x 720)

  The encoder brings its results in the output-directory.
  If this is missing, the output-directory is named after the basename
  (without extension) of the video file.

  The encoder produces sizes.js which documents the status of the encoding and
  the resulting size and URLs to request the variants.
  The syntax is window['video_<baseName>'] = "<statusMessage>" or
  window['video_<baseName>'] = {label:'<label>', file:'<file>', image: '<posterFile>',
  	width:<width>, height:<height>, bandwidth:<bandwidth>}
  The encoder also produces an HTML file embed.html which can be included as an
  element containing, once the process is finished, the video element
  presenting the video with a selection based on screen resolution.
  The path references there are prefixed with path-prefix, the
  optional third argument (or as property -DpathPrefix).
